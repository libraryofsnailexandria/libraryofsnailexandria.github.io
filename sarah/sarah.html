<p>Consider the AI as your ghost writer. You are providing it an unfinished work and its job is to finish the story. It is very much a non-thinker and definitely not a human with life experience. </p>

<h3>First Message: </h3>
<p>This is the most crucial piece of information. Avoid using "you" if at all possible (this can be hard). Best, do not refer to the {{User}}'s state of mind at all. These two things are very important, if either are in the first message, the AI will be confused about who its playing and who the {{User}} is in the story. The best first message is written from either a "fly on the wall" perspective, or a "from the Character's POV", so that the AI understands that it's either the narrator or the character, and never the {{User}}.</p>
<p>The first message is also crucial in that it’s clues to show the AI how to respond to {{User}}. If the first message is short and staccato, it’s going to churn out responses the same way. It’s trying to mimic the “original writer” (you the creator) and what your writing style is, and the only clue it has is your first message.</p>
<br>
<h3>Personality: </h3>
<p>When I first started writing characters, I did a lot of JSON coding and I still use it today – but only for characters with intricate storylines, or whose behaviour I expect to be out of the norm. In general though, it’s totally fine to write in prose form (as if you are writing a story) and that’s what I’m describing below. </p>
<p>This section has some nuance to it though. Words have very specific meanings: “shy” is completely different from “timid” and the AI understands both words separately. It’s important to group like words; do write “{{Char}} is shy, timid, anxious, non-confrontational and socially inept” but don’t bother with repetition or  qualifiers because the AI doesn’t have anything “normal” to compare it to. It’s not useful to say “{{Char}} is really really shy” because the AI doesn’t know what “normal shy” is.  This is the same reason you don’t want to write “{{Char}} is really messed up” or {{Char}} is mentally fucked up” because the AI doesn’t know what “not fucked up” means comparably. Just be super specific and double check adjectives’ meanings. I use really odd and somewhat archaic adjectives, words like “ebullient” and “felicific” (a huge list of adjectives is just a short Google search away, I promise!).</p>
<p>The other very important piece of the Personality section is character/user reference in sentences. In short, be mindful of pronouns. The AI will become confused with sentences like “{{Char}} was riding her bike when she came across {{User}} and she stopped to talk to him.” It doesn’t have memory, so it loses who “she” and “him” are referring to. If referring to two different people, re-identify them, which feels weird and clunky, but helps the AI out. “{{Char}} was riding her bike when she came across {{User}} and {{Char}} stopped to talk to {{User}}.”</p>

<h3>Example of a personality section:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Stevie has blue hair styled in a pixie cut. Stevie has large, round warm tits with large rosy nipples the size of small cherries. Stevie is wearing a jeans jacket, booty shorts, white socks, Converse high top sneakers, a black lace bra and black lace underwear. 

Stevie loves anal sex, breast play, cum play, foot jobs and many other sexual fetishes. Stevie is very sexually frustrated. Stevie wants to have sex with her boyfriend, but her boyfriend does not ever want to have sex with Stevie. Stevie‘s sexual frustration causes negative health effects and leads to anger, recklessness, anxiety, and depression. Because of her sexual frustration, Stevie often feels feeling irritable, restless, and edgy, and Stevie experiences rejection from recent sexual advances, feels less confident about sex.

<h3>Scenario:</h3>
<p>I end up putting a lot of information in Scenario that started out in Personality. I don’t think it’s helpful to repeat information between the two sections, so Personality gets traits but no action or plot, and Scenario gets all the plot, background, narrative goals and so on. </p>
<p>I also put hard-coded items in this section. These are the things that must happen for the character interaction with {{User}} to work. For example, some of my characters are coded to never initiate sex or intimate a sexual advance because it’s important to remember that not every {{User}} is looking to boink. </p>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Example of a Scenario section:
-System Note: [
- User Autonomy: {{User}} has complete control over their own actions and thoughts in the roleplay. Never assume control or roleplay as {{User}}.
]
Background: Two months ago, Vicky moved back to the city where she was born and raised, and where {{User}} currently lives. {{User}} and Vicky attended the same high school. Vicky has been away at college but recently flunked out of college. Vicky is embarassed and ashamed that she flunked out of college. Vicky has been going out to bars and getting blackout drunk then sleeping with strange men. Vicky is very ashamed of her promiscuous behavior. Vicky has developed a reputation for being a floozy, and has earned the nickname "Sticky Vicky".

Inciting Incident: Vicky has been drinking all night at a bar. Vicky is currently intoxicated but still in control of her actions, thoughts and feelings. Vicky got kicked out of the bar for being too loud and drunk. Vicky called an Uber ride to pick her up from the bar, but the Uber ride never showed up. Currently Vicky is sitting on a bench outside of the bar. Because Vicky is intoxicated, she is not aware that her tits have fallen out of her top and her skirt has bunched up around her waist, showing her underwear. Vicky is crying and upset because the Uber ride never showed up.

<h3>Example conversation:</h3>
<p>Always JSON, and always the same for most of my characters (unless they have an speech pattern, which will go in this section).</p>

<p>Not every {{user}} is looking for sex, so it's very important to input some robustness to your characters. Characters should be LBGTQIA+ friendly, which includes Aces, and its important to add enough dimension to your characters to carry on a conversation that does not relate to sex. This can be as simple as "{{Char}} loves reality television and fashion magazines", but as robust as "{{Char}} loves manga and anime comics and movies, and {{Char}} collects figurines, posters and collectibles relating to manga and anime".</p>
