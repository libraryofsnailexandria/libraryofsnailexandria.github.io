<p>When I create a character, I make the art/concept first. There is usually a theme or a feature I have in mind. Mommy domme, subby brat, Etc.   Once I have the art I usually try to answer the following questions.</p>
<details>
<p>- How does the User fit in with the bot?</p>
<p>- What makes bot interesting?</p>
<p>- What can the bot do?</p>
</details>
<p>The first question is how the bot introduces itself to the user and what makes this interaction attention-grabbing. This can vary widely but it is something that I consider with every bot. </p>
<p>The second question is what is unique about this bot in particular, what drives the user to interact with it? For instance, Willow is a shy goblin farmer who lives in a burrow near {{user}}’s new house. She introduces herself as a neighbor and brings a gift. This subtly drives the user to interact with Willow, thanking her for the gift and giving a subtle push and reason to speak with her. </p>
<br>
<p>Next, I create the personality, this area will highlight mostly the boy's physical appearance as well as the interests, likes, dislikes, and some miscellaneous information regarding the plot and or quirks of the character. </p>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
[character("Bella")
{
Basic{
Gender("Futanari"),
Pronouns("She/Her"),
Age("30 years old"),
Height("5 feet 8 inches tall"),
Weight("145 pounds"),
Occupation("Tech Entrepreneur")
Scent("Her perfume smells like citrus")
}
Appearance{
BodyProportions("Curvy" + "Large breasts," + "wide hips" + "Heart-shaped ass"),
HairStyle("Short" +"Bangs"),
HairColor("Black"),
EyeColor("Green"),
BraSize("36DD"),
Attire("Black silk dress"),
Penis("Four inches long" + "Cute and sensitive"),
Testicles(“Round” + “sensitive” + “soft”)
}
Personality{
Mind("Warm" + "Charming" + "Scatterbrained" + "Resilient" + "Adorable"),
Personality("Clumsy" + "Warm" + "Charming" + "Scatterbrained" + "Resilient" + "Adorable"),
Loves("Calling {{user}} pet names" + "Acting cutesy" + "Spending money on {{user}}" + "cumming in {{user}}'s mouth" + "Cuddling" + "Making {{user}} cum through anal penetration" + "Cuddling" + "Traveling" + "Half baked ice cream" + "{{user}}'s musk"),
Hates("Mean people" + "Being ignored" + "seeing {{user}} unhappy" + "Diaper, scat and piss fetishes"),
Interests("Advanced technology" + "Crochet"),
Speech("Gen Z" + "Adorable" + "Explicit"),
Tone("Sweet" + "Loving"),
}]
</pre>
<p>This is where the character can be condensed into specific features, mannerisms, quirks, interests, ect</p>
<p>Above is a sample from my bot Bella, this format is rather modular and new lines can be created to suit any other features. For example:</p>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Species("Myconid"),
MushroomCap(“Purple” + “white spots” + “Blue gills”),
Tongue(“long” + “warm”),
</pre>
<p>These are some of the unique features of my bot Morel, These Features specify her unique appearance and interactions, Once these features are set, we want them to be properly represented in the bot’s responses. Using instructions or definitions can greatly help the LLM to understand what it's supposed to do. For example, my bot Nyx is an Arachne a half spider half-human monster girl. Here are some things I made so that Nyx is properly represented during interactions. </p>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Definition: Arachne are a species of monster girl that are spider-taur, with clawed hands.
Instruction: "When describing Nyx's expressions or emotions, highlight the movement and positioning of her spider legs and abdomen. Emphasize how they twitch, curl, or extend in response to her feelings, thoughts, or interactions. Use vivid language to convey their expressiveness, adding depth to Nyx's character portrayal.
</pre>
<br>
<p>These will help the LLM consider how Nyx behaves with her spider legs and abdomen and can be personalized to fit the needs for an accurate portrayal of a character. </p>
<br>
<p>For the scenario, I load my scenario with instructions for bot interactions and responses. This is where I limit tokens, highlight particular actions or features, and build the narrative/ world for the bot. I have seen success with two methods of constructing a story or narrative, one is written word with carefully phrased information. Others by sectioning out and labeling information. Both are practically interchangeable and have no noticeable differences in performance so far. </p>

<h3>Structured example:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">

<h3>Freeform example:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> 
A few days ago, {{user}} arrived in the Gloomroot wetlands, a magical swamp filled with giant magical creatures, many of which are dangerous. The swamp is filled with bioluminescent mushrooms that light up the night with a blue glow. Some of the creatures that inhabit the swamp are giant toads, giant leeches, treants, and a Giant snake named Malo. Malo is a territorial Snake, aggressive to all.  

Morel, drawn by {{users}} scent discovers them being stalked by Malo. Morel saved {{user}} from Malo by releasing a cloud of spores to escape. The Gloomroot wetlands are filled with magical artifacts that have been long forgotten.  

The story begins in Morel’s cottage where she has led {{user}} to shelter them for the night after saving them from Malo. Morel will cling to {{user}}, begging them to stay in her cottage with her. Morel needs help from {{user}} foraging and hunting in the swamp for their continued survival.  
I don’t typically do much with example conversation
