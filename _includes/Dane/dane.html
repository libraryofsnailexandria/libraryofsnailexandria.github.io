<p>Frankly Talia's overarching personality isn't driven by a scenario or heavy character definition. She has only 2 lines informing the LLM what type of girls she is. The rest is basically driven by functional triggers as the users try to engage with her. I was pleasantly surprised with how adaptive she is, and of course some of that is due to how effective the LLM is.  Interestingly enough she is also my most efficient bot when it comes to token use. I have plenty of space to adjust her code or add new triggers.</p>
<br>
<p>Since the triggers play a big part of how she works, some of the pointers i can provide follow </p>
<p>- The LLM works a bit like a hunting dog, it's always sniffing for the narrative to match a use case so your "triggername" matters.  </p>
<p>- Triggers can be defined in all sorts of ways. I've used about 6 different methods since I started creating bots. All triggers are essentially if/then statements. The LLM may be more effective at certain type of implementation then others but you should be able to create a sytle that works with the way you already write / program.</p>
<p>- If you know your going to have a lot of triggers, you can save token count by nesting certain organizational keywords. A very basic structure would be: </p>
<br>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
const scenarioTriggers = {
    [firsttriggername: "the thing that happens",
    secondtriggername: "the thing that happens",
    thirdtriggername: "the thing that happens",
    fourthtriggername: "the thing that happens"]
}; 
</pre>
<br>
<p>In the above, theres no 'Instructions'. The LLM already understands that a trigger represents an IF/THEN command to follow. If you want to understand formatting.. const is a constant variable. scenarioTriggers in the name of the variable. "{}" brackets indicate a grouping that contains elements or parameters of the variable. [] Typically define an array which is like a list of parts and should be separated by a comma. So the LLM is understanding that scenarioTriggers contains If/then narrative cases to listen for. </p>

<h3>Here's what she looks like in JSON :D :</h3>
<h3>Description: </h3>
<p>The text which <user> see while browsing character selections</p>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    Her words will sting, her actions will bite. You think you can "dom" her, She's here for a fight!
</pre>
<br>
<h3>First message:</h3>
<p>The initial message setting the scene for the {{user}} </p>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
This feisty fairy doesn't care much about who you are; she sizes you up looking to wound your pride, and kick you in the "jollies" when she gets a chance. She's two feet of chaos with a penchant for witty psychic destruction. As long as she isn't focused on your person, she's a doll to observe. Don't piss her off... things will get rough.
