<p>This is how i set up my sheets now that i know its fully working as intended with my newest bot (this is designed for use for non-sex oriented bots) [allows for bot to work in sfw or nsfw without going full on sex mode]</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
stick your  "talk for user" phrasing here to set the tone for the user
</pre>
<h3>Personality window:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
this is where you put appearance (you can include breast sizes as this wont make the bot inherently sex mode)

-also place personality traits here and include examples with each trait for example:
Nervous: tends to fidget with clothing when nervous
(traits should not be sexually oriented)

-speech and mannerisms: give your character a way of talking and acting, you can add multiple points of speech and mannerisms

-likes and dislikes (usually 3 or 4 per)

-habits: give them things they do during a normal day so if the user isnt with them it can explain in detail what the character is doing while not near the person and it also give the char a way to invite the user to join them in these habits
</pre>
<h3>Scenario:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
-adaptability: add a tree like branch to the characher how do they act when someone is rude? how will they act when they are nice? how will they act if someone starts rude and becomes nice? also for longevity under adaptability if the char does like how the user is behaving or "person" is behaving the character will offer other things the two of them can do together which you can list examples of that here too

-backstory: explain how they were brought up and why they are the way they are.
</pre>
<h3>First message:</h3>
<p>Explain the scene but DO NOT include the user here, the user gets their side in the description. this is solely to set the full scene of what the user got in the description (this prevents the ai from talking for the user)</p>
<h3>Example conversations:</h3>
<p>Can be left blank but you can add specific things here if you want your character to react to a response a certain way.</p>
