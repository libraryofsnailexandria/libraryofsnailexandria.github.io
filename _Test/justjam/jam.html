<h3>How to use: </h3>
<details>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
name:     - name of the character. I can add there that LLM is quite good in understanding meaning behind the names, so you can use it for your advantage.
idea:      - general idea for character. Because of nesting, this note should be included before more detailed descriptions, so you can put there core idea of the character that should always come first in character decisions and reactions.
age:       - age of the character.
gender:    - gender of the character. Doing futanari needs a bit more work like specifying genitalia in 'appearance'.
