                <h2>Basics of Bot building:</h2>
                <h3>Plain text:</h3>
                <details>
                    <p>It's exactly what you think, you write your Scenario, Personality and everything else with plain text without using any sophisticated syntax. This style works great for open ended scenarios where stories and descriptions are most important as it conveys a lot of the detail that the other choices of bot building don't</p>
                </details>
                <h3>W++:</h3>
                <details>
                    <p>W++ is a JSON-like syntax that segregates the information into clearly defined tags, such as character name, height, appearance, personality, etc. Its information dense form allows it to convey a lot of key points to the LLM while sacrificing fidelity.</p>
                </details>
                <h3>JSON:</h3>
                <details>
                    <p>JSON is exactly what it sounds like. It's literally JSON, it has a more complex syntax than W++ and is generally a good way to convey a lot of dense information while sacrificing some of the fidelity.</p>
