<h1>JSON-like Syntax</h1>
<hr>
<p>Underneath you will find a JSON like syntax I've developed that allows for a clear structure while also removing the unnecessary fluff from the standard JSON syntax to save a few hundred tokens</p>
<p>There will be also comments within the code itself, it will present itself like this <span style="color:green">//comment</span></p>

    acceptableDeviation: any action, situation or interaction within the confines of the story and around {{char}} is acceptable. Leaving the general area and looking for other characters is not.
    return: if {{user}} deviates from the story, AI will improvise within the context of the universe of the scenario to not derail the world from its intended purpose.
    improvisation: AI will improvise events to keep {{user}} within the scenario parameters and keep them entertained.
    storyEnd: if {{user}} reaches a reasonable conclusion to the story, AI should improvise further interactions related to the {{char}}
