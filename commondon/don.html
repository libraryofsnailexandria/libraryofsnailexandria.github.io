<h1>The Method</h1>
<h3>The most important part of making my characters: </h3>
<p>I have to have a spark. I don’t like making characters for no reason, I always have some kind of goal or spark in mind when I write them. For some characters, it’s to test a certain composition style (Allison was an experiment about forcing emotionlessness), or it can be about a certain character concept (the Eternal Horizons pair, or BEAU, for examples). </p>
<br>
<p><b>My biggest writer’s block comes from this first step: </b>I have to have some kind of initial investment.</p>
<br>
<h3>The next step I take is diving into the character sheet:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
I use a rather standard W++ format, and I have a default template that I start with for each character. 
It’s got the very basics such as Gender, Attire, and Hair, but I also use some fields to specify the important things that are likely to come up, that I don’t want the AI to forget about. 
</pre>
<h3>The primary example: </h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
A line where I specify genitalia (yes or no to vagina, penis, and testicles). The AI can get carried away and overlook the obvious, but including gender and genitalia has made it reliable for that. Other important fields include Speech Patterns and Behaviors, but again, a lot of this should be familiar if you’ve read other guides.
</pre>
<br>
<h3>It’s around this point that I decide on an image to use:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
This choice is critical! The image is the first way that Users “interact” with your character, and also is the baseline for the Image Generator to use as a template. There’s a few key points to selecting a “good” one. 
First: decide on any specific features and poses. If you know how your scenario is starting, then that can influence your choice. The Users will be seeing what they’re getting off the bat. Maybe you want them in a more neutral situation, as they’re going about their routine. 
I typically lean towards the latter: I use images that put their personalities on display. For Boss, that’s a shorty with ten stories of attitude. 
</pre>
<h3>Once the sheet is done, the real fun part opens up: </h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"></pre>
writing the scenario! As I mentioned before, sometimes I go into this process with one in mind. That makes it much faster. I think about the ideal background between the User and the Character, how well they know each other, how they are meeting. I make sure I take note of specific “rules” about what’s going to happen. For Hannah, this took up a huge portion of my tokens. I noted the initial environment, things that live in the area, and importantly, how Hannah thinks. Since she’s an expert survivalist and xenobiologist, she knows what to expect quite intimately, and will guide the user to getting some essentials established. Some of the rules there mention how the other critters will react to Hannah and the User. 
<br>
<p>At this point, the rest is smooth sailing, and the next point is the First Message. This one has more importance than some may realize! It’s extremely easy for me to get carried away here. I honestly assume most readers don’t actually read the description, so I recap the events leading up to their meeting here. Then comes setting the scene, describing the character, and their first words. Critically, the AI uses the length of the message here to influence their following messages! I need to strike a balance between telling the User what they need to know, and not giving the AI too much, to keep their messages short.</p>
<br>
<h3>Last:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Example Dialogs. This is a cinch. Similar to the Personality section, I have a templated message for this. Naturally, the actual examples themselves are unique, but very easy. 

I use a handful of lines, each one being a single sentence that the Character would realistically use at some point. Examples that put their Speech Patterns on display are priority number one. Tips’ examples are chock full of Cutie and her trademark laugh, while Marble has a slice of profanity with her casual chatter. 
</pre>
<p>After that comes the fine details. The Description field should be seen as your tagline or slogan, the thing that draws users in, with a short and sweet pitch. Tags are often underrated, as they determine one of the few ways Users find your character after they leave New. All that leaves is the Voice, which is new at the moment, and the best advice I can give is: go with your heart, here.</p>
