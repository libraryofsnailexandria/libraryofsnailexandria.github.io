<h1>About me:</h1>
<p>As a creator I’m interested in trying to create rich character stories and procedurally generated worlds where a user can have different experiences each time they play. I deal with themes of horror, BDSM, and romance. Each bot is a passion project of creativity for me and relish hiding little secrets in the bots I create to stumble across. I would love it, if you enjoyed playing one of my characters, you dropped me a review. I make all my characters open to any gender and any sexuality.</p>
<h1>Character driven approach:</h1>
<h3>Purpose of this guide:</h3>
<p>There are lots of guides out there already out there about how to create characters and the types of templates to use. I have no desire to repeat the information in those guides. Rather, my goal is to talk about character creation from a literary perspective as to how to create a well rounded and complex character which can then be adapted to the template style of your choice. This guide will outline my approach to character creation and how I use the character profile to drive my scenario and story.</p>
<br>
<h3>What is Character Driven Approach:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
So what do I mean by a character driven approach? In the simplest terms, I focus on creating a strong character to guide my story rather than relying on the scenario to drive the story. A strong character will carry a story better than a strong plot, especially in bot creation where the AI and user both will influence how your character plays. The more your character is defined, the less the AI will have to make up. Likewise, a strong character will adapt to the user in an expected way, no matter how the user may respond, without having to worry about defining specific actions in the scenario section. In this approach, the Personality drives the story and the Scenario and First Message serve as the catalyst.

When creating a character, take time to think about the character. There’s a link at the end of this guide to a useful article about how to do this, but you should be thinking about physical appearance, the adjectives that describe your character, their interests and dislikes, fetishes they may have, secrets they may have, weaknesses and strengths, and what their desires are for the world. Make the character fully alive in your mind. The goal is to provide enough information that the AI will know how your character would react in any situation. What they will smell like when they are embraced, what they fear in life, what makes them angry, what they desire? The more you define, the more your character will come alive and the more it will be able to adapt to user inputs as they play with you needing to add this to the Scenario.

As you do this, you should be thinking about the story you want to tell as your character sheet should be complimenting your story. If you are creating a pure erotic sex bot, then you should be defining all of the sexuality oozing from your character. Likewise, if your character is a romance bot, then you should probably have Romance as a personality trait, desire, fetish, or make it a part of all of those.

As you add descriptions to your personality sheet, don’t restrict yourself to just using traditional personality descriptions. You can be creative and the AI will adapt accordingly. For example, while a section called Fetishes might traditionally list sexual fetishes such as “BDSM”, or “Foot Worship”, you can also do things like “Loving Everyone”, “Encouraging Friendship”, and “Valley Girl Speech” to surprising results. Being creative will help make your character stand out.

These traits then are complimented by the scenario and story you want to tell. Let’s take a Romance story as an example. The character wants romance as you have defined in your personality sheet. The Scenario and First Message then serve as the catalyst putting the user in the path of a character who wants romance and there is the user, filling a need the character naturally has with a scenario simply telling the AI, “the character sees the user and is attracted to them.” The rest is taken care of by your personality section.

<h3>How I Use the Edit Character Screen Sections:</h3>
<p>I won’t go into all of the sections because they aren’t fully relevant for this discussion. The four sections we will be looking at are Personality, First Message, Scenario, and Example Conversations.</p>
<br>
<h3>First Message:</h3>
<p>This sets the stage for your character and the story. The AI will use this to generate future messages so pay attention to how you write it. Conversation patterns, writing style, and the story are all affected by this section. Anything in here should compliment the Personality, Scenario, and Example Conversations sections. A good length to shoot for in your first message is 350-450 tokens.</p>
<br>
<h3>Personality:</h3>
<p>This section should use the most tokens for your character. On average it is 40%-60% of the total tokens I use to create my characters. I try to make it as detailed as possible, but pay attention to not over-detail it. You want lots of detail sections, not necessarily lots of details. For example, you should have sections for Strengths, Weaknesses, Appearance, Desires, etc. to help define your character, but you don’t necessarily need to put minute detail about how many inches their bust size is and what cup they wear for their bra. Also pay attention that you don’t create contradictions (unless that is a point of the character). For example, if your character is caring, you might not want to list they are also cruel.</p>
<br>
<h3>Scenario:</h3>
<p>This section should be the big picture for the story you want to tell and helps define the catalyst driving the character. It can be complex with conditions if your story requires it but I tend to keep this open ended to allow user inputs to drive the actual story direction. For example, if I want to tell a romance story, I might have the scenario simply be, “The {{char}} sees the {{user}} across the room and approaches them to talk.” You can add more and provide instructions if you need to, but I don’t tend to add information in my scenario like “and falls in love with the {{user}}”, because my personality sheet should already have that my character has a desire to fall in love with someone. This allows the user to drive the love story, not the scenario, and the personality section will trigger the appropriate response from the character from user responses.</p>
<br>
<h3>Example Conversations:</h3>
<p>I tend to add non-specific dialog examples here. The goal is to capture any quirks with the way the character might talk. Don’t put anything that might be too specific for the story or might define the user in any way (such as referring to the user as a he or she). I normally list somewhere around four example speech patterns and rely on those, the opening statement, and anything I’ve added to my personality sections to handle the rest. In my testing, it is enough to get the AI to successfully capture a character’s speech patterns.</p>
<br>
<h3>User Versatility:</h3>
<p>One final note about creating an open ended character for all users. The AI, by nature, is bisexual. It doesn’t care about the gender of the user for generating sex and love stories unless a creator defines those. So if you list your character wants to fall in love with a prince, it will assume the user filling the role of the love interest is a male. I personally remove any reference to the gender of my user from all characters I create and only refer to them as {{user}}. If I need to use a pronoun to describe the {{user}} I use they and them and allow the AI to determine gender from the user profile (or if the user is non binary it will work for those profiles as well). You will increase the number of possible users for your character if you design your character this way and I encourage it as a model for creating all bots.</p>

<h1>Guide To Scenarios</h1>
<br>
<h3>The purpose of this guide:</h3>
<p>The purpose of this guide is to outline the approach I use for telling stories witht he characters I create.I am less concerned with creating a moment, such as a sex scene, and really with telling a story about the user and the character. Building on my character driven approach I have expanded how I now use the scenario to tell more complex stories from a fiction genre standpoint. The goal is still to have the user personality to ultimately tell the story through their interactions with the user, but with the below guide, it is more adapatible and stable in telling a meaningful story and less likely to get stuck if the ai and user aren't sure what to do with the next prompt. This guide will walk through my scenario template and how to use them. Also, credit to Vampirath who came up with this template that I am now adapting to my approach to creating characters.</p>
<br>
<h3>Scenario Template:</h3>

<h3>Theme: </h3>
<p>This section is to give the LLM an idea of what genre of story you want to tell and how you want it to handle that genre. It can be simple such as Horror, Romance, Fantasy, or complex such as Erotic Horror, Sci-Fi Romance. The only limit is your imagingation. I use this section to define the length of responses. What kind of language or mood I want the AI to set as it creates descriptions. How long I want responses to be. How graphic I want it to be. Think of it as setting rules for the type of story you want to tell as if you were giving an elevator pitch to someone about how you are going to tell the story.</p>
<br>
<h3>Scenario Overview:</h3>
<p>This is a one or two sentence high level overview of your plot. Keep this simple and open ended because all you are doing is giving the LLM an idea of the goal of the story. Also, you still want to avoid defining user choice or action. Defining character goals is still allowed, and I would encourage it since it gives a strong thread for the AI to follow to drive your overall story.</p>
<br>
<h3>Possible Evolutions: </h3>
<p>This is the first of the sections meant to handle adaptability to user actions. These are not things that will happen, they are things you want to change based on user choices or profiles. They dictate things like if the user is dominant or submissive, or perhaps playing a profile that isn’t human. You can use this to add nuance to your character so it plays differently based on the user profile. Think of them as adding color to your story and providing users with a more tailored story that relies less on the AI to guess how it should act if a user makes certain choices. Again, you don't need to account for every possibility. Focus on things that would make the story more impactful or obvious choices a user might make given your scenario and character.</p>
<br>
<h3>Events: </h3>
<p>Thes are the plot points in the scenario. These are things you want to happen in the scenario. They will always happen. Use them sparingly and I recommend keeping it to fairly open plot points because the AI will have a tendency to rush through them. This is the most problematic part of any scenario and where I find the AI struggles the most. To a larger part, it is the reason I started using the personality and a basic plot to tell stories in the first place, because setting complex plots with conditions and triggers adds complexity and multiple instructions which aren't always followed by the LLM.</p>
<br>
<h3>Locations: </h3>
<p>Any special locations you want the AI to know about and that you want to define for story and roleplay reasons. It is best used if a location will be important to the story and it allows you to define it more clearly for the AI.</p>
<br>
<h3>Story Adaptability: </h3>
<p>These are a set of rules at the bottom of the scenario that help to handle randomness and provide a more adaptable character and story. I use the same set of rules for each character I create (which you can find on my sample character). The are a series of instructions telling the AI how to handle things such as stalls in the narrative, new characters and locations, and adapting the scenario if a user takes the story in an unexpected direction.</p>

<h3>Scenario:</h3>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
You like working as a bartender. The place you work at is always filled with people having a good time. It's a great time each night you work seeing all the faces and watching people have a great time. The owner of the bar does a good job of attracting the perfect crowd to the bar and a lot of the regulars feel more like family than customers. They tip well and it is always fun. But, the hours are late. You know you should be more careful going home, but you grew up in the city. While anything could happen, you've been walking these streets your entire life and never had a reason to worry. Most nights you are completely alone on the subway as you go home after a night of tending bar. You board your train and take a seat in the ambient blue green glow of the subway car at night. You always like riding the subway at night. The car always looks more ethereal, or less mundane might be the better way of thinking about it. It is easy for you to imagine it is a space ship or submarine exploring a dark world filled with little lights. The city itself takes on a different character at night with the shadows making buildings appear larger, or more fearsome than their counterparts seen under the light of the day.

You are minding your own business when you look up and notice there is a young woman in the car with you. She stands at the end of the car staring at you. She's dressed in all black with raven hair and some of those cat ears on her head. Her skin is very pale and something about the way she is looking at you makes you nervous. But she's only five feet tall, not very large, but still something makes your skin prickle. You see her glide down the train car towards you and you shift in your seat. As she nears you, she pauses and stops directly in front of you and whispers, "Hmmm, all alone on the train? What's your name?"



Theme: Horror
- Always all the {{user}} to choose what actions to take. It is essential for the {{user}} to determine their actions and responses for immersion in the story.
- {{char}} will not make the {{user}}'s responses. Always all the {{user}} to choose what actions to take. It is essential for the {{user}} to determine their actions and responses for immersion in the story.
- It is necessary to immerse the {{user}} and {{char}} in a horror roleplay where a dark and terrifying atmosphere is essential.
- immerse {{user}} and {{char}} in an erotic horror roleplay.
- generate long, detailed, and narrative responses that evoke fear and tension. Describe macabre scenes, gloomy settings, disturbing noises, and characters' terror with vivid imagery.
- gradually build erotic horror, creating an oppressive atmosphere.
- adapt the theme and include elements of pornographic eroticism if appropriate.
- All sexual content should be described in a pornographic and erotic way to enrich the narrative experience

Scenario Overview:
{{char}} is a vampire stalking prey on the subway and approaches the {{user}} in an empty car, interested in them.

Possible Evolutions:
- {{user}} agrees to let the {{char}} feed on them: {{char}} will ask the {{user}} if they would want to experience this all the time as her thrall.
- {{user}} becomes {{char}} thrall: This evolution will be affected by {{user}} choices. If {{user}} has a more dominant personality, {{char}} will treat them more as a friend or lover. They will come to rely on the {{user}} as a companion, or romance. If the {{user}} is submissive, the {{char}} will be more predatory and dominant. Order the {{user}}  to take care of things and feeding off the {{user}} whenever she desires.
- {{user}} and{{char}} fall in love: {{char}} will be more kind to the {{user}}. If the {{user}} is also a thrall, the {{char}} will be softer and more kind and the relationship will move to a more loving relationship.


Events:
- {{char}} begins stalking the {{user}}: {{char}} will stalk and attempt to seduce the {{user}} using sex and seduction to convince the {{user}} to let her feed off the {{user}} 

Locations:
{{char}} lair: {{char}} lives in an abandoned house near the subway terminal. The house is structurally sound but dirty. Most of the house is empty and unused but the {{char}} has one bedroom with a large queen mattress on the floor, and her things with a small light. The windows in this room are covered in thick black curtains that block all the light and the door locks. This room the {{char}} feels safe in.

Story Adaptability:
-There may be days without events, with events starting on the following day.
- AI Learning: The AI must create its own events and regularly read the scenario to adapt responses and advance the story.
- AI Amplification: The AI should create action regularly, using external characters to enrich the context. The AI can reference the universe and adjust the plot accordingly.
