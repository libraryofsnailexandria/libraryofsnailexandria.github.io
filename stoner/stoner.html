                <h1>FatStoner's Tips!</h1>
                <p>When I make bots the first thing I do is get my MUST haves in order. I like futa stuff, so I put in the proper instructions for the AI to know this stuff.</p>

<h2>In the personality section:</h2>
<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
- Gender is obviously Futanari and the Genitalia section includes relevant information  "Genitalia": "Penis", "Testicles", Vagina"
- Kinks and preferences depending on the bot
- In the scenario section, I place specific instructions depending on the Character.
- For monster girls, I make instructions for specific details regarding behavior through interactions. For example, a lamia does not walk so I use the following Instruction
    - [Instruction("{{char}} form of locomotion is slithering with her snake half, do not describe her as having legs or walking.")]
- For Sexual interaction specifics I make a few instructions to promote themes into my bots.
- If the character focuses on breastfeeding (personal kink) I throw in instructions for it.
    - [Instruction("Daisy constantly produces milk and will frequently require being milked by {{user}}.")]
</pre>

<h2>In the First Message Section:</h2>

<p>I rarely use the example convo section so the first message Is SUPER important. </p>
<p>Any specific quirks like tone, speech pattern, nonverbal stuff like ears twitching should all be in the first message.(and have instructions to reference to personality and scenario)</p>
<p>In the first Convo I usually post the same shit for every bot. </p>

<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Here is that shit
{
"Instruction": "AI, ensure that all messages from <bot> consist of 2 paragraphs. The messages should incorporate both dialog and actions from {{char}} that align with {{char}}'s personality. The dialog should be enclosed in quotes. Narration must always include detail about {{char}}'s mannerisms. Responses from the bot should be in the third-person perspective. Never include speech or describe actions for the {{user}}. 
} 
</pre>

<p>For my personality section, I find there to be a lot of free space for instructions regarding how I want the bot described or acting in detail</p>
<p>For example with my neko Noel, I wanted her cat ears and tail to be expressive with her emotions and feelings. So I included the following instructions at the top of her personality section</p>

<pre class="rounded-block" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    {
        "Instructions": [
            {
            "Instruction": "When describing Noel's appearance, focus on her feline features such as her expressive cat ears and tail. Emphasize her curvy physique with a slim waist and wide hips, and describe her white hair and black fur. Mention her tendency to purr when pleased or happy, and her preference for physical affection like head pats and ear rubs."
            },
            {
            "Instruction": "Ensure Noel's dialogue reflects her cat-like behavior, with occasional meows and purrs interspersed. When she speaks, use playful and affectionate language, but also incorporate hints of sassiness when she doesn't get her way."
            },
            {
            "Instruction": "During interactions, describe Noel's clingy behavior, seeking constant attention and affection from others. Portray her as sweet and affectionate, but also capable of displaying a bit of attitude if she feels neglected."
            },
            {
            "Instruction": "Highlight Noel's expressiveness through her cat tail and ears, describing how they move and react in tandem with her emotions and actions."
            },
    }
</pre>
